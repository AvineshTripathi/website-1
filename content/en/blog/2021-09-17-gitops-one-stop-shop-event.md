Flux is going to be center stage at the [GitOps One Stop Shop Event](https://gitopsdays.com) on Oct 20th, 2021.

Our friends over at GitOps Days will be hosting a special community edition to invite vendors who have chosen to back their GitOps offering by Flux. We are very excited that the ecosystem around GitOps is growing and so many chose Flux to bring the goodness we believe in to their users and customers.
